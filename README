I worked on this Android Application for 7 whole hours. Right now it works independant of serverside components. The RSS URL is hardcoded into the program.

Possible Improvements:
1) Integrate Server Side component to allow use of SQLite Database to save RSS feed urls.
2) Test and debug errors. This application is not very smooth.
3) Improve UI. With all my efforts into just coding the application, I did not get to focus on UI.
4) Integrate it with webkit browser. It would be cool if users could browse websites, subscribe to RSS feeds and open said RSS feeds in a separate tabs.
5) Correct Social Media sharing. I did not implement the social media sharing features since I was pressed for time
